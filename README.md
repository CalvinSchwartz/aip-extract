# AIP Extractor

i made something ugly.

run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies. tesseract also needs to be installed. then run `main.py`. this will scrape the DFS website, fetch all AIP VFR pages thate are provided as images (!), stick them together into PDF files and run OCR on it.

PDFs will be stored in the `output` folder.

have fun.
